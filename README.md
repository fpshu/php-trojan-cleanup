# php-trojan-cleanup
This handy script was written to find and remove malicious php codes injected into first line of php files. The script searches recursively in *.php files for specific pattern, and removes any matching block. It takes no difference whether the code is minimised or not.

**Usage:**
- detect [directory] : detect malicious code in the given directory
- cleanup [directory] : remove malicious code in the given directory
- help : this help :)"
